SETUP
=======
You need a web server of some kind installed.  I've been using Apache but any standard server should work.

You must have your mp3 files in a directory your webserver can see.  The easiest way to do this is to create a symlink from your mp3 directory to your a folder in server's directory.

Now place this repository on your webserver and do the following:
- Open up playexplore.php
- Edit lines 32, 35, 37 (look at the comments by these lines for more information).

And that's it.  Put your server URL into your broswer and stream away.


LOGIN
=======
This comes with a very simple login system.  The password is hardcoded in a php file.

The login system comes disabled.  To enable it:
- Open login.php
- Line 9 says 'f($_POST["pword"]=="99bottlesofbeer"){'
	- Replace '99bottlesofbeer' with your new password
- Open index.php
- Line 5 says '$_SESSION["login"]=1;'
 	 - Comment it out or delete it
